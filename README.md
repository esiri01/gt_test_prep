# Georgia Tech Test Prep

Welcome to the Course Review Helper repository! This repository contains interactive tools designed to help students review and master course material through self-testing with generated questions.

## Features

Each app in this repository generates multiple-choice questions to help students review material for a particular course:

- **CS 7280 Network Science**: Review questions based on course content, lectures, and personal notes.
- **CS 7643 Deep Learning**: Questions covering key concepts in deep learning.
- **ISYE 6740 Computational Data Analytics**: Review material for computational data analytics.

## Why These Apps?

These tools were created to support active learning through self-testing, which is often more effective than rewatching lectures or rereading course materials. Each app includes GPT-generated questions as well as relevant questions from the courses and similar classes from other institutions.
