        'A) In the CBOW model, the projection matrix is shared among all context words.',
        'B) The Skip-gram model uses multiple projection matrices depending on the distance of the context words.',
        'C) In the CBOW model, all context words are projected into the same position in the projection layer.',

    ],
    'correct_answer': 'D',
    'explanation': (
        'Option D is incorrect because the Skip-gram model does not use a different projection matrix for each context word. Instead, it uses the same projection matrix to predict all surrounding context words. The other options accurately describe aspects of the CBOW and Skip-gram models.'

    ],
    'correct_answer': 'B',
    'explanation': (
        'Option B is correct because the training complexity of the Skip-gram model increases compared to the CBOW model. This increase is due to the Skip-gram model\'s objective of predicting multiple surrounding context words for each target word, which requires more computations.'
