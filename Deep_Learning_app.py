The app features GPT-generated multiple-choice questions based on course content, lectures, and my personal notes, along with relevant questions from the course itself and similar classes from other institutions.
I began creating tools like this because I believe that actively recalling information is a more effective way to learn than simply reviewing course material.

1. **Chapter Review**: Select specific chapters to review and answer questions related to those chapters.
2. **Big Review**: Select multiple chapters for a comprehensive review session.
