    "# Definition of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Markov Decision Process (MDP)** is a mathematical framework for modeling decision-making under uncertainty. It consists of the following components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **State Space ($S$)**: Represents all possible configurations of the environment. A state encapsulates enough information about the system such that the future is independent of the past, satisfying the **Markov Property**.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Action Space ($A$)**: The set of all possible actions the agent can take.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Transition Model ($T$)**: Describes the dynamics of the environment as a probability distribution $P(s' \\mid s, a)$, where $s'$ is the next state given the current state $s$ and action $a$. In deterministic cases, $T(s, a) = s'$.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Reward Function ($R$)**: Maps each state-action pair (or state-action-next-state triplet) to a scalar reward. It quantifies the immediate benefit of taking an action in a specific state.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Discount Factor ($\\gamma \\in [0, 1]$)**: A factor that reduces the weight of future rewards, emphasizing short-term rewards over long-term ones. Rewards $n$ steps into the future are weighted by $\\gamma^n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Policy ($\\pi$)**: A strategy that maps states to actions, specifying the behavior of the agent.\n",
    "   - **Deterministic Policy**: $\\pi(s) = a$\n",
    "   - **Stochastic Policy**: $\\pi(a \\mid s)$ gives the probability of taking action $a$ in state $s$.\n",

    "## Exploration vs. Exploitation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Concept Overview\n",
    "The exploration vs. exploitation dilemma is a fundamental tradeoff in reinforcement learning (RL). It reflects the challenge of choosing between:\n",
    "1. **Exploitation**: Leveraging current knowledge to maximize immediate rewards by choosing the best-known action.\n",
    "2. **Exploration**: Taking potentially suboptimal actions to discover new states or strategies that might yield higher rewards in the long term.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exploration Strategies\n",
    "1. **$\\epsilon$-Greedy Policy**:\n",
    "   - With probability $1 - \\epsilon$, select the action with the highest Q-value (exploitation).\n",
    "   - With probability $\\epsilon$, choose an action randomly (exploration).\n",
    "   - Decaying $\\epsilon$ over time encourages more exploitation as the agent learns.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   $$\\pi(a|s) = \n",
    "   \\begin{cases} \n",

    "   \\end{cases}$$\n",

    "2. **Boltzmann Exploration**:\n",
    "   - Select action $a$ with probability proportional to $\\exp(\\beta Q(s, a))$, where $\\beta$ controls the balance between exploration and exploitation.\n",
    "   - Higher $\\beta$ focuses on actions with higher Q-values (exploitation), and lower $\\beta$ encourages exploration.\n",

    "3. **Entropy Regularization**:\n",
    "   - Encourages diverse action selection by adding an entropy term to the reward.\n",

    "## **Introduction**\n",
    "- **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)** are generative models that learn an explicit probability distribution to generate data similar to a given dataset.\n",
    "- They provide a **tractable approximation** of intractable optimization objectives in generative modeling.\n",
    "- VAEs integrate ideas from:\n",
    "  1. **Latent variable models**: Introduce unobserved variables \\( z \\) to capture factors underlying the data.\n",
    "  2. **Autoencoders**: Learn compressed latent representations of the input data.\n",
    "  3. **Variational methods**: Use approximate inference to optimize intractable integrals.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Key Concepts in VAEs**\n",
    "1. **Latent Variable Models**:\n",
    "   - Assume data \\( x \\) is generated via latent variables \\( z \\) sampled from a prior \\( p(z) \\), combined with a conditional distribution \\( p(x|z) \\).\n",
    "   - The likelihood of data: \n",
    "     \\[\n",
    "     p(x) = \\int p(x|z)p(z) \\, dz\n",
    "     \\]\n",
    "   - Direct optimization of \\( p(x) \\) is intractable due to the integral over \\( z \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Variational Inference**:\n",
    "   - Introduce an encoder \\( q_\\phi(z|x) \\) to approximate the true posterior \\( p(z|x) \\).\n",
    "   - The **evidence lower bound (ELBO)** provides a tractable objective:\n",
    "     \\[\n",
    "     \\log p(x) \\geq \\mathbb{E}_{q_\\phi(z|x)}[\\log p_\\theta(x|z)] - \\text{KL}(q_\\phi(z|x) \\| p(z))\n",
    "     \\]\n",
    "     - First term: Reconstruction loss measures how well \\( z \\) explains \\( x \\).\n",
    "     - Second term: Regularizes \\( q_\\phi(z|x) \\) to match the prior \\( p(z) \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Encoder and Decoder**:\n",
    "   - **Encoder** \\( q_\\phi(z|x) \\): Maps \\( x \\) to parameters \\( \\mu \\) and \\( \\sigma \\) of a Gaussian distribution in latent space.\n",
    "   - **Decoder** \\( p_\\theta(x|z) \\): Reconstructs \\( x \\) from latent variables \\( z \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Reparameterization Trick**:\n",
    "   - Sampling \\( z \\) from \\( q_\\phi(z|x) \\) is non-differentiable.\n",
    "   - Instead, sample \\( \\epsilon \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, I) \\) and reparameterize:\n",
    "     \\[\n",
    "     z = \\mu + \\sigma \\odot \\epsilon\n",
